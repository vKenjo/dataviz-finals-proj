CS ELEC 3C – Data Visualization Project Guidelines
Project Title: Visualizing World Development Indicators (WDI) - Addressing a UN
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)

Project Overview
In this project, students will analyze and visualize data from the World Development
Indicators (WDI) provided by the World Bank, with the goal of addressing one of the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Students will choose a global development
question aligned with an SDG and use data visualization techniques to explore trends, patterns,
and disparities across time and geography.

---

1. Project Background
   Introduce the nature and importance of your project.
   ● Describe the global issue your project will explore.
   ● State which UN SDG your project addresses (e.g., SDG 4: Quality Education, SDG 3:
   Good Health and Well-being, SDG 13: Climate Action).
   ● Explain the importance of this topic in the context of global development and policy.
   Example: “This project focuses on SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. We aim to
   understand how access to clean water has changed over time across income
   groups and regions.”

2. Statement of the Problem
   Define the research questions, objectives, scope, and limitations.
   ● Clearly articulate the problem statement: What questions are you trying to answer?
   ● Provide specific objectives (e.g., compare education levels across regions, analyze
   CO₂ emissions vs. GDP).
   ● Define the scope (countries, regions, time frame, indicators).
   ● Mention any limitations (data availability, missing years, indicator granularity).  
   Example Problem Statement: “How has access to primary education evolved
   across low-income and high-income countries over the past 30 years, and what
   correlations exist between education access and GDP per capita?”

3. Background on the Dataset
   Provide context and technical details about the dataset.
   ● Name: World Development Indicators (WDI)
   ● Source: World Bank Open Data (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator)
   ● Describe the dataset:
   ○ Time span (typically 1960–present)
   ○ Coverage (~200 countries)
   ○ Over 1,000 indicators grouped by themes: education, health, environment,
   economy, etc.
   ● Explain how the dataset is organized:
   ○ Columns: Country, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, Year, Value
   ● Mention any secondary datasets used (e.g., country regions, income levels).
   ● Note: Data can be accessed via the World Bank API, CSV downloads, or Kaggle
   datasets.

4. Literature Review
   Ground your project in existing work.
   ● Summarize studies, articles, or dashboards that explore similar topics or use WDI
   data.
   ● Explain how these works inform or inspire your approach.
   ● Highlight gaps or limitations in their visualizations or analyses that your project might
   address.

5. Methodology
   Break this section into subcomponents:
   a. Data Set
   ● Specify the indicators used (e.g., literacy rate, CO₂ emissions, mortality rate).
   ● Justify why they are relevant to your SDG and project question.  
   b. Data Preparation
   ● Describe preprocessing steps:  
   ○ Filtering countries, years, or regions
   ○ Handling missing values
   ○ Creating new derived variables if needed
   ○ Normalizing/scaling for comparability  
   c. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   ● Provide basic statistics, distributions, and data summaries.
   ● Use 3–4 preliminary visualizations to understand patterns (e.g., line plots, boxplots,
   histograms).  
   d. Data Visualization
   ● Create 4–6 polished and informative visualizations.
   ● Use appropriate chart types:
   ○ Time series for trends
   ○ Choropleth maps for geographic variation
   ○ Scatter plots for correlations
   ○ Heatmaps for indicator relationships
   ○ Interactive dashboards (e.g., Tableau, Plotly) encouraged
   ● Ensure clarity: label axes, titles, legends, and sources.

6. Data Analysis
   Interpret your visualizations and extract insights.
   ● Answer your research questions using your charts.
   ● Describe trends, correlations, differences between regions/income levels, and
   unexpected findings.
   ● Relate your findings to the SDG and global development priorities.

7. Conclusion
   Summarize findings and reflect on their implications.
   ● Restate your key insights and what they reveal about your chosen SDG.
   ● Discuss data or methodological limitations.
   ● Suggest policy or research recommendations.
   ● Offer ideas for future exploration (e.g., including more indicators or using machine
   learning).

Deliverables
A Team is composed of 2-3 students.
Each team must submit the following:

1.  Final Report (8-10 pages, ACM format)
    ○ Contains all sections  
    ○ Embedded and well-labeled visualizations
    ○ Clear narrative linking data to insights
2.  Code and Data Repository (GitHub or ZIP)
    ○ Include all scripts for data processing and visualization
    ○ README file with setup instructions
    Each Team will have a 10-min Presentation
    ○ Slides and dashboard demo
    ○ Summarize goals, visualizations, insights, and conclusions
